I've decided to start a blog. It will probably be called "prepared_mind". This is a reference to a quote by Louis Pasteur - "Dans les champs de l'observation le hasard ne favorise que les esprits préparés." In English, "In the fields of observation, fortune favors the prepared mind." I'm planning to write down some of my thoughts on my research and life. Will write my first real entry on the 29th, then update at least bi-weekly.
